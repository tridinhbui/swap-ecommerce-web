Welcome to Loop! This project was created as a part of Software Design and Development class (Fall 2023). If you want to learn more about the project, feel free to check out [our pitch deck here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1I4ZPFR0tH5jLC0tQIphFwFCdRPSYU3zqqOHcsWhmR14/edit?usp=sharing)

## Prerequisites

To run this project correctly on your machine, you must have the following installed:
1. Git
2. Node.js
3. npm
4. Microsoft Visual Studio
5. ReactJS

## Step 0: First Launch of ReactJS (skip to Step 1 if you have installed and used ReactJS)

If it is your first time using ReactJS on your machine, please run the following in your terminal:

### 1. `npx create-react-app my-app`
### 2. `cd my-app`
### 3. `npm start`

After that, you should see the "My First React App" website. If that it true, continue to next step. If not, please refer to the prerequisites.

## Step 1: Clone Our Project

If you used ReactJS before, please do the following in your terminal:

### 1. `cd <desired folder for the repo>`
### 2. `git clone https://github.com/acheredn/alta.git`
### 3. `cd alta`
### 4. `ls`

At this point, you should see the root structure of our project, including all the files and folders that we have on Github. If you do not see it yet, please make sure you cloned the repo correctly. You can also use Github Desktop to complete this operation

## Step 2: Run Our Project

Now that you have cloned Alta repository, you are ready to launch the project! Please do the following in your terminal:

### 1. `cd <desired folder for the repo>/alta`
### 2. `npm update`
### 3. `npm start`

If all the modules have been updated correctly, you should now have the website running on your computer!

## If something does not work

We constantly intall new and upgrade existing libraries and packages as we work on improving our project. If the website does not start, make sure you run

### `npm update`

before starting the app again.

If you accidentally close the app, you can always find it at http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

You may also see any lint errors in the console.

If you want to restart the environment in the terminal, while server is active, please press Ctrl/âŒ˜ + C -> type "Y" -> start over again!

## We Hope You Enjoy Loop!
